## Hi there 👋
🧠 Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Alparslan Önder, a passionate neuroscience researcher and biomedical engineer with a keen interest in exploring the complexities of the human brain. My academic journey has taken me through both a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering, where I specialized in electronics, data processing, and programming. With a focus on computational neuroscience, I've delved into advanced signal processing techniques and machine learning methodologies, particularly in the realm of medical image analysis. My research experience spans diverse projects, from developing spike sorting algorithms for real-time operation to investigating the effects of cognitive impairment on EEG signals in dementia patients. I thrive on interdisciplinary collaboration and am dedicated to leveraging technology to advance our understanding of neurocognitive disorders. Join me on this journey as we unravel the mysteries of the mind, one line of code at a time. 🚀
