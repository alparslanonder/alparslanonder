## Hi there üëã
- üß† Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Alparslan √ñnder, a passionate neuroscience researcher and biomedical engineer with a keen interest in exploring the complexities of the human brain.

- üéì My academic journey has taken me through a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering, where I specialized in electronics, data processing, and programming. 

- üíª With a focus on computational neuroscience, I've delved into advanced signal processing techniques and machine learning methodologies, particularly in medical image analysis. 

- üåê My research experience spans diverse projects, from developing spike sorting algorithms for real-time operation to investigating the effects of cognitive impairment on EEG signals in dementia patients.

- ü§ù I thrive on interdisciplinary collaboration and am dedicated to leveraging technology to advance our understanding of neurocognitive disorders. 

- Join me on this journey as we unravel the mysteries of the mind, one line of code at a time. üöÄ
